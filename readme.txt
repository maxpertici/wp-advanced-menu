== Description ==
Forget the walker and create powerful navigations with a real theme system.
WP:AM is a new way to quickly create a powerful, modern and personalized navigation menu for your website.
You can create WP:AM themes for your menus in the same way as you create WordPress themes for your websites.
This side-project is still in development, but you already have features bellow integrated into the plugin.

= Warning =
This plugin is intended for developers. It is still a phase of experimentation.
To create your custom menu, you can rely on the default theme. The override feature is there for that.

= Features =

* Theme
- Child Theme
Create child themes by defining a theme as a template. If you need a higher level, you can also define another theme as grand parent: origin.
- Library
Load your themes (or those of others) from a WordPress theme or plugin. Create your own library, reuse and improve your menus from project to project.
- Override
Quickly personalize an existing theme with the override system. Copy an item and customize it. Thatâ€™s it.

* Item
- Hierarchy
Catch an item easily with the hierarchy template system for post type, taxonomy, archive and custom items.
- Types
Each menu item now has a type to help you create more advanced menus. WP:AM also offers new types of elements such as the image type or the Gutenberg block.

* Panel
- Breakpoints
No need to rework your css files, you can now adjust your breakponts directly in the back office.
- Options
Add your theme options to the back office and configure your menu according to the needs of the current project.

* Misc
- ACF
WP:AM is built on ACF. So use your favorite fields and build your ideas :)
- Hooks
WP:AM likes hooks and is starting to create new ones to make life easier for developers.
- Cache
WP:AM is compatible with cache plugins. Your stylesheets will be properly supported.
- Translation
WP:AM is translation ready. Fortunately :P

== Installation ==
1. Install the plugin and activate.
